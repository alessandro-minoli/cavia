Ordering time: 4.64s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 7.01 seconds (4.35 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 3.82s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 9629 iterations, 5.32 seconds (2.16 work units)
