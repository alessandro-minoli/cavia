Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 5.24s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 8.12 seconds (4.84 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 4.89s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 10714 iterations, 6.40 seconds (2.50 work units)
