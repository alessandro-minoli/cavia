Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 0.42s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 2.77 seconds (3.06 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 0.45s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 4601 iterations, 1.03 seconds (0.85 work units)
