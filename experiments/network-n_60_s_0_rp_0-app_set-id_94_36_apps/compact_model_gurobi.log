Deterministic concurrent LP optimizer: primal simplex, dual simplex, and barrier
Showing barrier log only...

Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 3.51s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 6.16 seconds (4.85 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 3.11s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 7312 iterations, 4.08 seconds (1.55 work units)
