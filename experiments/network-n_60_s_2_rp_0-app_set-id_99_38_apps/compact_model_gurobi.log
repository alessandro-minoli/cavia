Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 1.48s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 3.74 seconds (3.41 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 1.25s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 6427 iterations, 2.08 seconds (1.22 work units)
