Ordering time: 3.61s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 5.65 seconds (3.70 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 3.01s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 7374 iterations, 4.15 seconds (1.70 work units)
