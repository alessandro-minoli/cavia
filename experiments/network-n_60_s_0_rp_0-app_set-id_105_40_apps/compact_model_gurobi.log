Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 0.31s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 2.79 seconds (2.97 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 0.46s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 2103 iterations, 1.00 seconds (0.68 work units)
