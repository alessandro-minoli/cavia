Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 2.14s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 4.98 seconds (4.10 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 1.99s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 4771 iterations, 2.84 seconds (1.42 work units)
