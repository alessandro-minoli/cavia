Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 3.46s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 6.08 seconds (4.21 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 3.04s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 8600 iterations, 4.17 seconds (1.80 work units)
