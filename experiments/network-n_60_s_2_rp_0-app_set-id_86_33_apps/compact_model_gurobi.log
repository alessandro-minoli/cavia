Ordering time: 3.22s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 5.38 seconds (3.22 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 2.92s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 4709 iterations, 3.78 seconds (1.29 work units)
