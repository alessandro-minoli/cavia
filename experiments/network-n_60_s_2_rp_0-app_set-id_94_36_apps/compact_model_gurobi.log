Ordering time: 2.84s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 4.97 seconds (3.40 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 2.62s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 5139 iterations, 3.42 seconds (1.22 work units)
