Ordering time: 3.56s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 5.57 seconds (4.23 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 2.72s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 10002 iterations, 4.09 seconds (2.21 work units)
