Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 2.91s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 5.13 seconds (3.70 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 2.48s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 7096 iterations, 3.48 seconds (1.57 work units)
