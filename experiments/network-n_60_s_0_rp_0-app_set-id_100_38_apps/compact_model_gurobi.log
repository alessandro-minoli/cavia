Ordering time: 4.80s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 7.41 seconds (4.41 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 4.42s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: infeasible, 7208 iterations, 5.69 seconds (2.06 work units)
